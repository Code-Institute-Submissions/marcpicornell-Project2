    CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript

# OTHER

    This is my second project to be delivered for Code Institute.
    If you read this file, thanks for taking the time.
    Drop me an email: marc@marcpicornell.com.

# WHY THIS
The Rock, Paper, Sizor ... wasn't really my first choice but I have already a day job who kept me very busy during the last few weeks.
I am finding incredibly hard to find the time required for Code Institute.

By definition I will try to focuss on how to deliver in a timely fashion.
