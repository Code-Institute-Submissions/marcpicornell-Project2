# OTHER

    This is my second project to be delivered for Code Institute.
    If you read this file, thanks for taking the time.
    Drop me an email: marc@marcpicornell.com.

# WHY THIS

    The Rock, Paper, Sizor ... wasn't really my first choice but I have already a day job who kept me very busy during the last few weeks.
    I am finding incredibly hard to find the time required for Code Institute but you do not do a carrier change without making some sacrifice.

    NO PAIN NO GAIN
