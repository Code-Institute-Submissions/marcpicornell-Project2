# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

## Description

## Approach
I am starting with the content layer, then the presentation layer and lastly the  behaviors layer.

Or if you prefer: HTML, CSS and lastly JAVASCRIPT.

Also, I would like to see if using WEBP (new web format for IMG) make a real difference.

### Images
Each image were extracted from the main banner listed in Credits.
I made a PNG with alpha channel to keep the ÃŸtransparent background.
I then convert them using (WEBP converter)[https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter].
